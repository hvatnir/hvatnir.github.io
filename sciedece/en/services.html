<p>This is a method of X-ray examination for the purpose of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment planning. The scanning process takes 30 seconds, after which we get a 3D image with a volume of 8 cm x 23 cm in three-dimensional projection, which allows us to explore the maxillofacial area invisible to the human eye, maxillary sinuses and joints with the maximum information content.</p>

<p>A safe examination is performed on a modern high-precision tomograph with a minimum load and does not have consequences on your body.</p>
